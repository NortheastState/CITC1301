Introduction to Programming and Logic
Instructor: David Blair

Topic: Chapter 2
==============================================================
In this chapter we will discuss:
    - software development process (steps)
    - understand input, process, output (IPO)
    - Python identifiers and expressions
    - use Python to output information to the console window, get
      information from the keyboard, and look at a "counted loop"

The Software Process:
    1. Analyze the problem - clearly state what the problem is
        that you are going to solve.
    2. Determine the specifications - clearly state exactly what
        your program will do and what it will accomplish.
    3. Create a design - here is where you state "how" you will
        accomplish what you put out in the specifications. This
        should also include types of testing. Testing should not
        be an afterthought. It should be an integral part of your
        design.
    4. Implement the design - Implement the design from the
        previous section into code. Start with pseudo-code.
    5. Test/Debug the program - Here is where do unit, functional,
        white-box, black-box, regression testing.
    6. Maintain the program - change the program by fixing bugs,
        adding features, or do refactoring.
