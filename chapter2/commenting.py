# Description: This should be a detailed problem statement. Here
#              is where you specify what it is you are going to
#              have your program do. Remember, you do not need
#              to solve the problem here. You need only state
#              the problem clearly and concisely.

#         Method: main
#     Parameters: greeting: String
#    Description: Print a greeting to the console window. Like
#                 the file header, each method header should
#                 describe what this particular method does.
#                 If you find that the method does more than one
#                 thing, then consider decomposing the method
#                 to several other methods.
# --------------------------------------------------------------
def main(greeting):
    print(greeting)

# inline comments should be pseudocode and can be a none-code
# way to solve the problem stated in the description.
main("Hello Foobar! Who dat!")
