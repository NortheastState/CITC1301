Introduction to Programming and Logic
Instructor: David Blair
Text: Python Programming: An Introduction To Computer Science
      By John Zelle Ph.D.
Topic: Overview
==============================================================

This course, like the name implies, is an introduction to
programming and logic. While we will use Python as the programming
language, it is more of an introduction into logic and problem
solving. It has been my experience over the years that students
have no problem mastering basic programming constructs, such as
if/else's, loops, and function calls. Good programming skills come
from understanding a problem and being able to work out
the details of that problems, then implement the solution in
code. Good problem solving and debugging is the very cornerstone
for computer science, regardless of the programming language.

Programming can be difficult to master. It may seem like a daunting
task, one that you either possess the skills to be successful or you
don't. This is simply not true. I have not met the student that
could not be successful in this course, or ones like it, that could
not succeed if they put in enough effort. Effort = success! Period.
Small effort = small success; Large effort = large success.

D2L
---
I use D2L for all just about everything. All quizzes and assignments
will be posted there under content. All assignments will be turned
into the dropbox in D2L. All grades will be posted there. This includes
all tests as well.

GitHub
------
I use GitHub as a way to get current class examples and materials to
you fast. You can easily clone the entire GitHub repository making it
simple to get all examples in one step. And of course, I will also post
this all this content on D2L, under content.
