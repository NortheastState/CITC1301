==============================================================

Our objectives for this chapter is:

    *   Understand the simple decision programming pattern and its
        implementation using a Python 'if' statement
    *   Understand the two-way decision programming pattern and its
        implementation using a Python 'if-else' statement
    *   Understand muli-way decision programming pattern and its
        implementation using a Python 'if-else-else' statement
    *   Understand the idea of exception handling and be able to write
        exception-handling code that catches standard Python run-time errors
    *   Understand the concept of boolean expressions and the bool data type
    *   Be able to read, write, and implement algorithms that emply decision
        structures, including those that employ sequences of decision and
        nested decision structures.
