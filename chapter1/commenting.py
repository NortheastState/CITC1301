# Description: This program outputs a simple hello message to
#              the console window. It also illustrates the use
#              of comments. All python files should have a header
#              that states what problem the program is solving.
#              In other words, what does the program do?
#

#---------------------------------------------------------------
#         Method: main
#     Parameters: greeting: String
#    Description: Print a greeting to the console window. Like
#                 the file header, each method header should
#                 describe what this particular method does.
#                 If you find that the method does more than one
#                 thing, then consider decomposing the method
#                 to several other methods.
#--------------------------------------------------------------
def main(greeting):
    print(greeting)

#inline comments should be pseudocode and can be a none-code
#way to solve the problem stated in the description.
main("Hello Foobar! Who dat!")
