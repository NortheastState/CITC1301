# Description: In the program we will examine simple output
#              using a function definition with no parameters
#              and a print statement.
#              Note that Python does not require a main function,
#              even though there is one behind the curtains you
#              you can't see, but it is customary to use one anyway.
#              Also, we will see later in the course that getting
#              use to using one will be a good thing to do.
#
# ===============================================================

# define the main function that takes no parameters.
# functions are not called when the program executes, instead it
# called only by name underneath.
def main():
    print("Hello Mr. Foobar!")

# make a call to the main() function above
main()
